# Lexical-Analyzer

1.	INTRODUCTION 

Our compiler is a user-friendly language compiler in which our describe language will be used through which we will first implement lexical analyzer, in which we will tokenize the input after that syntax analyzer will be implemented in which syntax of the input will be check through which we will know that the input is according to our describe language then semantic analyzer will ensure that the declarations and statements of a program are semantically correct.


2.	OBJECTIVES
This project is about constructing a compiler that is base on our +BU language.This language is a user-friendly language that is similar to C++ language by applying this language we will be able to construct a compiler on any programming language because every language needs a compiler to compile their idea. Through this compiler, we will be able to compile our idea.
	A lot of compilers are constructed for C++
	Because of existing systems, we can easily understand the ideas of the compiler phases.
